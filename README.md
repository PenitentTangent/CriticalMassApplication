1. NIGHT OF THE LIVING HOWLS (Unity Game)

Description/Context
- Instead of paying 60 dollars per person for the Global Game Jam, I organized a game jam of our 
own with my brother Armin (artist), and my friend Carlos(writer/designer) over the last 3 day weekend
(BC Family Day and actually my Birthday too! :D ).
- This is an isometric/2d game designed to have an arcade experience. You are a Vampire that roams
a creepy scottish castle pub that is dimly lit as werewolves spawn and attack you.
- The core game mechanic is that the werewolves can only be seen in light. So make sure to grab a torch!

My Role/Contributions
- As the main programmer of the team, I designed the code structure and implemented most of the functionality.
A non-exhaustive list of features I created:
    - Start/End screen with UI and buttons
    - An inheritance structure for all the interactables of the game by creating in IInteractable interface, and having
    enemies, torches, etc... all implement it.
    - Player/Enemy animations using blend-trees and state machines
    - Basic Wolf AI that tracks and follwos the player
    - Camera script that allows the camera to follow the player, while never exceeding the boundaries of the map (background).
    - UI interface to show player health, and have it decrease accordinly as you get damaged.

Additional Notes
- You can actually go play our game! I've included both a Windows Executable and a Mac dmg. I've also included the Unity project files.
- The game is a work in progress that we're very proud of! We actually intend to showcase an improved version with a scoring system
(and generally polished up) to the local "Full Indie" event this month in Vancouver!


2. COPYRIGHT TOOL

Description/Context
- This is a copyright python tool that takes a given directory, hunts for all cs files within, and tacks on a Copyright text at the
top of the file. You also have the option to submit changes to perforce!
- At my current job, my supervisor noted that we need to start copyrighting our project sripts (there are hundreds of them). So I decided
to make a python tool in my spare time.
- It started out as a simple
